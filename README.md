# Impractical Python Projects

Based on the book *Impractical Python Projects* by Lee Vaughan and published by **No Starch Press**.

Got this book via the *Learn You Some Python* at **Humble Bundle** (May, 2020).

>“You can think of this as your second Python book. It’s designed to follow and complement either a complete beginner’s book or an introductory class.” (Lee Vaughan)

## Chapter 01. Silly Name Generator

- Too many newlines
- I recently upgraded to **macOS Monterey** which does not install the Python IDLE. The `file=sys.stderr` in the print function does not turn the print output red when using the terminal.
